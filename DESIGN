For Smart Merge Join, check the metadata to see if it has been Sorted. If they have been, then
use as is. If not use the existing sort scan and copy the resulting table back into the main
table. Then those tables are merged. 

For Extensible hash, One main table stores the master index that are linked to the hash buckets.
It is essentially the top level of the extensible hash index. Buckets are created based off of 
bit values and all information is sorted is based on that. If the bucket cannot hold anymore, 
then the buckets split and are re-sorted. Buckets won't be created if the precision value is 
greater than 32 bit. Buckets are really tables, just different names.
