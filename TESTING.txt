We used a single pattern to test our replacement policies. We started by adding and pinning 8 pages in our
buffer pool. Then we unpinned the 7th page and added a new page we call 9. As such, the buffer pool goes from:

1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6* 7* 8* -> 1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6* 7 8* -> 1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6* 9* 8*

Then, we try adding a new page called 10. Since the buffer pool is full and all of the pages are pinned,
nothing changes.

We then unpin the 5th and 3rd pages in the buffer pool in that order. So the buffer pool goes from:

1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6* 9* 8* -> 1* 2* 3* 4* 5 6* 9* 8* -> 1* 2* 3 4* 5 6* 9* 8*

We then add a new page, 11, to the buffer pool. The results for this will differ between LRU and Clock. In LRU,
the 5th page will be replaced since it is the least recently used page that was unpinned. In Clock, the 3rd
page will be replaced since it is the first page that we encountered that could have it's contents replaced.
So for LRU, the buffer pool goes from:

1* 2* 3 4* 5 6* 9* 8* -> 1* 2* 3 4* 11 6* 9* 8*

In Clock, the buffer pool goes from:

 1* 2* 3 4* 5 6* 9* 8* -> 1* 2* 11 4* 5 6* 9* 8*
