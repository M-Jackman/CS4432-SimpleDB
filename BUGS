One bug that we found was that we couldn't update the metadata that a table
was sorted. The act of writing it to disk is pushing something out of memory.
We think that if the information was needed, it should have been pinned.
Or it was not pinned correctly. We believe that record page was becoming unpinned.

We tried doing larger runs but the metadata manager ran out of heap space
