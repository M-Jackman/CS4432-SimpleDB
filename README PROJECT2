The whole contents of the zip archive should be imported into Eclipse

In order to run TestQueries, the Startup file must be run and the folder
that is created must be cs4432 for the tests to be done correctly. Then
CreateTestTables must be run in order to create the database. Once those
are created, you can run TestQueries. Every time Startup is run, the
the folder containing the database must be deleted, not just the files, but
the whole folder. Otherwise, it will not run correctly. Right now the database
creates 100 tuples in order for quick testing.

Smart Merge Join tests were not working. They have been commented out.
